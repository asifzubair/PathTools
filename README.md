PathTools
=========

A collection of tools and algorithms suitable to work with paths (e.g., navigational).

Currently, this tool box consists of a framework for Markov chains. It is possible to fit navigational path corpora with varying order Markov chain models.
The framework includes several advanced methods for determining the appropriate Markov chain order (maximum likelihood methods, Bayesian inference methods and cross validation prediction).

For a basic introduction to the framework please refer to the test example. For further questions please conduct the issues section or drop me an email!
